# eat-n-split

**eat-n-split** is a web application designed to simplify splitting bills among friends. Whether you're out for dinner, lunch, or any shared expense, this app makes it easy to calculate and track who owes what. You can add friends to your list, share a meal, and split the bill based on who paid and how much each person contributed.

## Features

- **Friend Management**: Add friends with their names and profile images to easily track shared expenses.
- **Bill Splitting**: Share a meal and split the bill by selecting a friend and entering the amount each person paid.
- **Owed Amount Tracking**: After splitting the bill, the app calculates and records how much one person owes the other, depending on who paid.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you and a friend go out for dinner and the total bill is $100. If you paid $40 and your friend paid $60, the app allows you to record these amounts. You can then select who paid the bill. If you paid, the app will show that your friend owes you $60. It can work the other way around as well.
